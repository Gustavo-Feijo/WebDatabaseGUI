# JQUERY

This is my first Jquery project, the main goal is to learn how to use it in a effective manner, while developing a simple application.
The application is gonna be a web app with a database connection.
It's NOT intended to be used for sensitive data.
The project is gonna use a SQL local database, instead of a online database, in order to avoid any security issue, but can be easily migrated.
It's gonna be a GUI application to simplify the use of the database, but also mantain the terminal functionality if prefered.
